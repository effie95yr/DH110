
00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:01.050
Yi Ren: Okay.


00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.389
Yi Ren: hi Yuanjun.


00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.690
Yi Ren: Camille Okay, can we start again.


00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.599
Yuanjun : Can you see my face, my window?


00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.980
Yi Ren: Yes, yes.


00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.520
Yi Ren: But can we, can we, can you can wait for me to read you the introduction again because I forgot to record.


00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.650
Yi Ren: Okay yeah okay sorry, so thank you, Camille, for participating in our study.


00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.400
Yi Ren: So, first of all, we're not evaluating you in anyway, so we just want to look for information on how you do things online and see what works and doesn't work for you, so we hope we can.
just talk us talk as naturally as possible, and there are no right or answers to any of the questions I will be asking.


00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:09.360
Yi Ren: I'm just simply interested in understanding how you do things online, we will conduct the study mostly as a discussion, so I will ask you to show me how to do things using your computer.
and ask your questions to better understand what do you do okay. So first of all, I will ask you some general background information and then we'll we'll go through some tasks.


00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:33.510
Yi Ren: And while you are working on the tasks, I'd like you to think out loud, which means you give a running commentary of what's going on in your mind when you do every step online.


00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.580
Yi Ren: And you can talk about things you like, or you don't like and feel free to say anything during our discussion.


00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.050
Yi Ren: Um, so I started recording so that I can go back and review things later and make sure we get everything right.


00:01:49.710 --> 00:02:01.650
Yi Ren: I won't use your name in connection with the recordings or the results. Okay, the videos will only be used internally and will only be shared with my professor of the class I'm taking.


00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.150
Yi Ren: Is everything okay with you for now.



00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.840
Yi Ren: Okay, thank you. Any questions so far.


00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.520
Yi Ren: No? okay Thank you, Sorry I have to go through the questions again.
So first of all, can tell me your name and what you do.


00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.750
Yuanjun : My name is Yuanjun Zhu and I'm a lawyer, but I'm right now already currently working right now.


00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
Yi Ren: Okay, thank you, um, where do you mostly use your computer?


00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.050
Yi Ren: At home at home, what do you usually use it for.


00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.150
Yuanjun : For fun, like for, like browsing websites.


00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.860
Yi Ren: I see. Do you share computer with other people.


00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.680
Yuanjun : I don't share my personal computer with other people.


00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.430
Yi Ren: I see. How much time do you usually use your computer.


00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.450
Yuanjun : Depends, but three to five hours per day.


00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.130
Yi Ren: Okay okay.


00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.610
Yi Ren: Do you tend to seek information on your phone or your computer?


00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.940
Yuanjun : It depends on what kind of information, but if there's some kind of information, I need to do like Google search, it will be on my computer


00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.570
Yi Ren: I see I see. Thank you, okay.


00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.410
Yi Ren: Some background information, some background questions. Um so do you like traveling personally?


00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.000
Yuanjun : yeah.



00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.990
yeah.


00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.590
Yi Ren: How often do travel before COVID let's say.


00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.190
Yuanjun : i'll say, one international trips per year.


00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.310
Yi Ren: One international trip per year, okay, very cool.


00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:00.540
Yi Ren: So when you, for example, where you plan your trip to somewhere you've never been to, what websites, do you use the most.


00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.300
Yuanjun : I use Qiongyou lot.


00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.570
Yi Ren: What what kind of website is Qiongyou?


00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.920
Yuanjun : I think it's just like.


00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:25.620
Yuanjun : it's similar to Tripadvisor and it has like a lot of bbs which allows people to share their own travel experiences and post their own blogs and photos about the travel stories.


00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:38.550
Yi Ren: I see, did you use the website every time for your before you travel when you plan your trip?

Yuanjun: Yeah. 

Yi Ren: okay okay when did you first start using it, do you remember?


00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.620
Yuanjun : About 10 years ago.


00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.490
Yi Ren: Okay okay sounds good, so the website has been at least 10 years old.


00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.650
Yuanjun : I mean, I would say it's like i'm not like not 100% sure.


00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.260
Yi Ren: Okay.


00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.910
Yi Ren: Okay, thank you um do you usually search for the Qiongyou website, or do you just jump directly to it.


00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.020
Yuanjun: I'll search for it. 


00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:27.960
Yi Ren: Could you please share your screen? Okay Thank you so much, so now imagine that you are planning another trip and I, you will be visiting someplace you've never been to in the United States let's say.


00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.970
Yi Ren: So what kind of information do tend to seek first the very first what kind of information do.


00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.330
Yuanjun : You mean like I already know my destination.


00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:48.330
Yi Ren: yeah so let's say let's see let's, um, is there any where in the United States, you want to.


00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.890
Yi Ren: Go but never been there before



00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.150
Yuanjun : Hawaii.


00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.940
Yi Ren: Hawaii sure to Hawaii.


00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:08.340
Yi Ren: So imagine that you will be planning your trip for how I what kind of information, do you usually look for first.


00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.050
Yuanjun : Oh I'll go to Google Flights first.


00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.940
Yi Ren: For sure. And?


00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.470
Yuanjun : Kind of like just randomly pick some.


00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.570
Yuanjun : This afternoon Hawaii.


00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.420
Yuanjun : Hawaii...It is like something called Honolulu I think. 


00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.540
Yi Ren: Honolulu is, I think, on another island. I think Hawaii has a lot of islands


00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.460
Yuanjun : Anyway, yeah I think I will do a Google search first.


00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.570
Yi Ren: uh huh.


00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.230
Yuanjun : Well, so unnecessary information I don't care.


00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.370
Yuanjun : I don't care.


00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.520
Yuanjun : Okay, take for us #####.


00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.230
Yuanjun : Okay####.


00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.150
Yi Ren: Okay, so you will search for the flights first.


00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.230
Yuanjun : Mm hmm.


00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:10.020
Yi Ren: So how do you decide, for example, accommodations or or restaurants, where to eat or where to, to, to, to stay.


00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.710
Yuanjun : I think I generally will go to Qiongyou.


00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.090
Yi Ren: Go go to the website you use.


00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.320
Yuanjun : I think I was just like randomly like search.


00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.240
Yuanjun : Sure, I was saying, Hawaii and.


00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.460
Yuanjun : Just like, see



00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.680
Yi Ren: you just click on the first result of the Google page right?


00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.030
Yuanjun: Yeah.


00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.760
Yi Ren: and?


00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:09.060
Yi Ren: So you kind of sort the discussion topics, according to the publishing date.


00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.870
Yuanjun : yeah, just like the most earliest ones. 

It seems also to be like closer ones are better.


00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.220
Yi Ren: I see. I see.


00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.300
Yuanjun : So I just browse kind of like just read them and see what people do, and I will just input anything.


00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:42.750
Yi Ren: For example, so so you you use this website for both, for example, accommodations and for transportation and for, for example, sightseeing places all of those information.


00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.920
Yuanjun : yeah I'd like to read about people, then when you read about more people, so you find they do similar things.


00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.300
Yi Ren: Oh, I see.


00:08:51.360 --> 00:09:06.360
Yuanjun : And then you're kind of like that.
There is another thing I may do, which I kind of I started doing right now, is go to Hawaii's, like, official travel website, because I went to Alaska recently.


00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.210
Yuanjun : And I feel like sometimes they're all like.


00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:16.320
Yuanjun : State website has a lot of information, so I can look at those things to understand what's going on.


00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:24.090
Yuanjun : But I think I generally will just go to Qiongyou first, just like to read, to read through other people's like travel stories first.


00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:34.680
Yi Ren: What kind of what kind of, for example, information, do you use-, do look for on the official government website, for example.


00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.000
Yuanjun: um.


00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.530
Yi Ren: What do you think would be useful to you?


00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.810
Yuanjun : Health protocols?


00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.620
Yi Ren: Sure sure.


00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.270
Yi Ren: During COVID, yes.


00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.450
Yuanjun : Yes, I think it's actually while I was searching for Alaska, I think I searched a lot about...


00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:02.760
Yuanjun : What what was happening right now, because a lot of information, right now, online was not updated enough because of the COVID. 


00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.100
Yuanjun : So be on like real estate websites kind of like allows you to be able to.


00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.740
Yuanjun : get access to the most updated things you know what's going on, like if anything changed because of the COVID.


00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.200
Yi Ren: I see. Can we go to the Alaska official website? 
And show me how you searched for information there?



00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.000
Yuanjun : I don't know. 
I kind of forgot actually. 


00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.460
Yi Ren: You forgot. Okay.


00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.450
Yuanjun : What is this?


00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.110
Yuanjun : I think it's this one. 


00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:49.080
Yuanjun : One, this is the Alaska one. 
Is is this the Alaska one?
I feel actually I don't think so. 
Oh yeah this is.
So they will have, like, you know, you can decide where to visit, it depends on which destination places you want to go.


00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.650
Yuanjun : And they will tell you like, because of why you know, certain kind of dates.

It will teach you ### things.


00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:02.280
Yuanjun : And they also just like because Alaska had a lot of day tours, and they can recommend what day tours you have?


00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:09.210
Yuanjun : This is particularly helpful because when I was looking at other people's like you know on Qiongyou. 
I look at other people's suggestions. 


00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:17.790
Yuanjun : People say "hey we go on a glacier tour. It's good to go on a glacier to this city." 
But sometimes they do not provide enough information on which one you choose.


00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:27.240
Yuanjun : And here like this, you can see, like what other companies are doing that and provided the access to it, which is like, for example, for glaciers tours.


00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:39.900
Yuanjun : You can just see like, they will just tell you, which are the glaciers tours and what time they have, and valuable price, and over so it's kind of like easy for you to read a review everything at the same page.


00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.310
Yi Ren: I see. I see. Okay, so, for example, how do you-
So we'll search for, for example, when you search for information on the government website, compared with when you search for information on Qiongyou, what do you think the major difference is?



00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:09.180
Yuanjun : I would say for like on Qiongyou, I look for other people's personal opinion.


00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.060
Yuanjun : And I feel like I would just consider them as more subjective opinion, but I will give them a lot of weight, but I feel on government websites I'm more like i'm searching for information.


00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.780
Yuanjun : I'm looking for something like accurate.


00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:33.750
Yi Ren: I see, I see. Okay. Sounds good, thank you.
So, for example, just by browsing Qiongyou and Hawaii's official website just now, are you satisfied with what you saw on the websites?
Did you-
Do you think you can find all the information you wanted.


00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.350
Yuanjun : Hmm, no?


00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.730
Yi Ren: No, why is that? 
What is missing or?


00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:03.690
Yuanjun : Hmm.
There's just too much information you need, and you cannot find it at like just two places.


00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:14.100
Yi Ren: I see. 
So, so you mean that it just takes more time for you to find information you need.


00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:15.870
Yuanjun : I mean.


00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:30.720
Yuanjun : yeah I think it's just like, I think it's just why I was like looking for Qiongyou.
I think i'm looking for like a bigger picture of like where I want to go and similar to like how you have a bigger picture of like what is there.


00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:39.330
Yuanjun : But you definitely have to click on much more things and just to make sure every piece of information was there and it definitely involved more more website that you need.


00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.870
Yi Ren: I see. I see. Okay.
So if I-
Please correct me if i'm wrong, so if I-
If to summarize the way you plan your trip, you will first of all, for example, browse the discussion topics on Qiongyou. 
And then get a summary of what people are doing, where are where people are staying, and what people are eating in the place.
And then, and then, you will also look for government websites to to to seek more accurate updated information.
Is that correct.


00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:35.310
Yuanjun : Um yeah I would say, like, uh, while I was looking for Qiongyou, I was looking forward to like about higher level of where I want to go in this place.


00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:41.190
Yuanjun : And where is the place I want to travel to, and if they have like any good recommendations.


00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:50.580
Yuanjun : And not every like Qiongyou post will have like, you know, recommendations on like places to stay and eat.
But if there are, I may take notes of them. 


00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:57.240
Yuanjun : And after I have like a general idea of like where I want to visit, I will go to the government website.


00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:09.060
Yuanjun : And also other websites, including Google Flights, you know, trains like you know, car rentings, to make sure the transportation makes sense and how to pick everything together.


00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:20.850
Yuanjun : And after that I would likely know just to search generally like on booking.com and on Xiaohongshu, which I use it as a phone app, not on my computer.


00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:33.120
Yuanjun : And, and also like Yelp, just like to have a good, but not really Yelp, like generally those places, just to have an idea to like to book the hotel.


00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:49.530
Yuanjun : And to book everything I need to book.
But I just feel like Qiongyou may be just like a first step of my, you know, understanding of what is going on in that place and where I can possibly just to travel to what kind of like events or like, you know, things I can do, like a day tours.


00:15:50.430 --> 00:16:05.160
Yi Ren: I see. I see. Got it, okay.
Thank you so much for all your input.
Those are all very helpful. 
Okay before we end our study today, any questions you have for me?


00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:13.380
Yi Ren: No? No? Okay, I guess, then that's all of our meeting today.
Thank you so much.


00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.270
Yuanjun : you're welcome.


00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.360
Yi Ren: Okay, let me stop recording.
