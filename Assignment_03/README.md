### Design Challenge 

This study is aimed to gain insights on how people employ Internet resources to plan trips. Specifically, this study seeks to learn what information trip planners will prioritize and where trip planners tend to go in order to gain such information. 

The traditional solutions of this goal might include turning to travel guides, such as Lonely Planet, or rating websites such as Yelp and Tripadvisor. 

Nonetheless, the traditional solutions have limitations such as inaccurate, subjective reviews on the rating websites or outdated information on travel guides that are updated only annually. 

Therefore, this project aims to support users in finding a way to provide both accurate and updated information when they plan their trips. 

### Target Users 

The target users of the design are adults who enjoy traveling as a hobby and who have the desire to plan their own trips instead of participating in a tour group when travelling. The target users of the design are also Internet users who are familiar with basic Internet searching skills. 

The users will do the focus activity on the Internet, as I would like to design a website that can be accessible to all potential users worldwide. 

The goal of the activity is to make users search for the information they prioritize the most when they start to plan a trip. 

### Research Methods 

In order to gain insights on how users search for travel-related information on the Internet, I decided to conduct a contextual inquiry. 

I recruited one participant for my contextual inquiry. The participant is a friend of mine, whose demographic background, preferences, and expertise fit the potential target users of the design. The participant is a frequent traveler, enjoys travelling as a hobby, is familiar with designing trips by herself, and is familiar with employing Internet resources to gain information. 

Since the activity is designed to be conducted online, I chose to conduct the contextual inquiry virtually. As tracking participants’ constant moves on the Internet might be difficult, I decided to take advantage of the screen recording function of Zoom and asked the participant to demonstrate the activity with her computer screen being recorded. 

In the very beginning of the contextual inquiry, I asked for the content of the participant of screen-recording, read through the guide of the study, and informed the participant that her personal information would only be shared within the class. 

Then  I started to gather demographic information. I asked the participant about her name, her occupation, and how she uses her computer. 

Then I initiated the questions that were specifically relevant to the current study. I asked the participant for her opinions on travelling, her frequency of travelling, and her preferences of planning trips. 

In the next step, I asked the participant to start the activity, which was to search for the information she prioritizes the most when she plans a trip to somewhere she has never been to before. During the activity, the participant was asked to think out loud and describe each step verbally. 

After the completion of the activity, I asked the participant whether she was satisfied with the results and asked follow-up questions according to her answers.

### Data Analysis

Please see the screenrecording video [here](https://ucla.zoom.us/rec/share/EPoBrgjfSiAf_MHbhY2eAkQSE-hKUvKnB5emZzRaw4SoQUH02TIfBeBq4D1MVYyd.fc2PQ3ErLwxgl-CM?startTime=1634604206000) (Passcode: dh110hw03!). 

Please see the trasncript of the interview [here](https://github.com/effie95yr/DH110/blob/main/Assignment_03/DH110_assignment03_transcript.txt). 

First of all, the participant prioritizes the transportation the most when she starts to plan a trip. The very first step of the participant was to search for the cost of round-trip flights to the destination. 

As for the specific itinerary, the participant highly relied on reviews of previous travellers to gather basic information about accommodations, local transportation, and tourist attractions. The first resource the participant turned to was a Chinese BBS website where people share travel stories. 
> I think I generally will just go to Qiongyou first, just like to read, to read through others like travel stories.

> I'd like to read about people, then when you read about more people, so you find they do similar things.

Another resource that the participant chose was the official local government website of the destination. According to the participant, the official government website could offer more accurate, up-to-date, and objective information. The participant also found the local health protocols particularly helpful during the pandemic. 
>It’s like real official websites kind of like allow you to be able to get access to the most updated things you know what's going on, like if anything changed because of the COVID.

When reflecting on the activity, the participant provided the feedback that one critical issue with the government website was that the high density of the information made it hard for users to quickly access the necessary information. 

> There's just too much information you need... and you cannot find it like two places.

> I think it's just why I was like looking on Qiongyou (the BBS website). I think I'm looking for like a bigger picture of like where I want to go and similar to like how you have a bigger picture of like what is there.

### Reflection 

The study  presented me the potential needs of the target users when performing the focus activity, which allowed me to further adjust my design. Nonetheless, the contextual inquiry was far from complete. First of all, due to the small size of data, the information I gained from this particular session might not be generalized to all the target users of the design. In addition, as the instructions of focus activity in the study were not given clearly, the participant ended up describing what she usually did when she planned previous trips instead of actually showing the steps. Overall, the contextual inquiry was insightful as it provided me with the necessary information on how target users tend to solve the target problem with more traditional solutions, the limitations of which I should work on to solve with my design.
