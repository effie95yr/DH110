### Design Challenge 

This study is aimed to gain insights on how people employ Internet resources to plan trips. Specifically, this study seeks to learn what information trip planners will prioritize and where trip planners tend to go in order to gain such information. 

The traditional solutions of this goal might include turning to travel guides, such as Lonely Planet, or rating websites such as Yelp and Tripadvisor. 

Nonetheless, the traditional solutions have limitations such as inaccurate, subjective reviews on the rating websites or outdated information on travel guides that are updated only annually. 

Therefore, this project aims to support users in finding a way to provide both accurate and updated information when they plan their trips. 

### Target Users 

The target users of the design are adults who enjoy traveling as a hobby and who have the desire to plan their own trips instead of participating in a tour group when travelling. The target users of the design are also Internet users who are familiar with basic Internet searching skills. 

The users will do the focus activity on the Internet, as I would like to design a website that can be accessible to all potential users worldwide. 

The goal of the activity is to make users search for the information they prioritize the most when they start to plan a trip.
