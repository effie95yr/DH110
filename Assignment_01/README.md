## Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

### Project Description

In this project, I aim to analyze how the website of Hawaii government functions as a guide to its services on language access, linguistic diversity, as well as natural and cultural heritage protection. As the government of a state with citizens from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, the government of Hawaii is responsible for providing support to those from the under-resourced groups, and the website of the government is supposed to offer clear and accurate information as well as user-friendly instructions on where and how to seek help.

### Heuristic Evaluation of the Official Website of Office of Language Access of Hawaii State

First of all, my motivation for chooseing to anaylze the website of the Office of Language Access (OLA henceforth)is my interest in how the Hawaaii government provide support for those who are Hawaii citizens but not native English speakers. According to the "about page" of the OLA "works to ensure that persons who do not speak, read, write, or understand English are able to access services, programs and activities provided by: State government agencies, courts, and schools; and State-funded organizations, including medical and social service providers". 

I think the OLA website fulfills the most heuristics overall. 

The system status of the website is quite visible, as all the links on the website are clearly marked with different font sizes or underlined texts. In addition, the nevigation bar on the top is also marked with multiple arrows pointing down, indicating that there are dropdown menus. 

The system and the real world are also matched well, as the all the language used on the website is easy to read through. However, I found that the website only provides an English version, and as an office that aims to help those who do not read or speak English, I found the lack of translations into languages inconsistent with the purpose of the office.
