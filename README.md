# Travel in Hawaii: A Portable Travel Guide Designed for Tourists of Hawaii
--- 
## Introduction 
For this project, I designed a smartphone application for the official government of Hawaii that targets potential travelers who are interested in visiting Hawaii. First of all, this application aims to provide updated and accurate information on sightseeing attractions for visitors, such as whether the sightseeing location is accessible, whether masks or vaccination records are required, or whether the place is family-friendly. Specifically, the application aims to allow travelers in Hawaii to browse sightseeing attractions as well as upload travel photos and diaries of their own. In addition, the application also aims to help potential travelers to Hawaii create and manage their itineraries, budget plans, and travel logs.

## Design Statement 
In my user research, I found that potential tourists of Hawaii have three major types of needs, which include obtaining accurate and up-to-date information, managing trip plans and logs, as well as interacting with other travelers. Nonetheless, there does not exist one platform that fulfills all three kinds of functions of potential tourists, and thus, by designing this application, I intended to contribute to the tourism of Hawaii, which is one of the pillar industries of Hawaii, by providing a portable travel guide that meets the needs of potential travelers who are interested in visiting Hawaii. 


## Competitor Analysis 
I conducted a competitor analysis of the existing page for travelers on the website of the Kauai County of Hawai. First of all, I conducted a heuristic evaluation on the current webpage for visitors in order to have an initial idea of whether the website offers clear and accurate information for a satisfying user experience. Based on the heuristic evaluation, I found that the current page has issues of 1 to 2 severaity ratings with almost all the heuristics，especially with ineffective error prevention, low visibility and flexibility, as well as lack of freedom and control.

I also conducted a pilot usability test, where I specifically designed a scenario for potential visitors and recruited one participant to actually perform the task and and further examined whether the issues found in the heuristic evaluation actually negatively affect the user experience of the website. The usability test helped me recognize the design issues of the website more accurately from the perspective of users.
