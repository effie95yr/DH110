# Travel in Hawaii: A Portable Travel Guide Designed for Tourists of Hawaii
--- 
## Introduction 
For this project, I designed a smartphone application for the official government of Hawaii that targets potential travelers who are interested in visiting Hawaii. First of all, this application aims to provide updated and accurate information on sightseeing attractions for visitors, such as whether the sightseeing location is accessible, whether masks or vaccination records are required, or whether the place is family-friendly. Specifically, the application aims to allow travelers in Hawaii to browse sightseeing attractions as well as upload travel photos and diaries of their own. In addition, the application also aims to help potential travelers to Hawaii create and manage their itineraries, budget plans, and travel logs.

## Design Statement 
In my user research, I found that potential tourists of Hawaii have three major types of needs, which include obtaining accurate and up-to-date information, managing trip plans and logs, as well as interacting with other travelers. Nonetheless, there does not exist one platform that fulfills all three kinds of functions of potential tourists, and thus, by designing this application, I intended to contribute to the tourism of Hawaii, which is one of the pillar industries of Hawaii, by providing a portable travel guide that meets the needs of potential travelers who are interested in visiting Hawaii. 


## Competitor Analysis 
I conducted a competitor analysis of the existing page for travelers on the website of the Kauai County of Hawai.
