# Travel in Hawaii: A Portable Travel Guide Designed for Tourists of Hawaii
--- 
## Introduction 
For this project, I designed a smartphone application for the official government of Hawaii that targets potential travelers who are interested in visiting Hawaii. First of all, this application aims to provide updated and accurate information on sightseeing attractions for visitors, such as whether the sightseeing location is accessible, whether masks or vaccination records are required, or whether the place is family-friendly. Specifically, the application aims to allow travelers in Hawaii to browse sightseeing attractions as well as upload travel photos and diaries of their own. In addition, the application also aims to help potential travelers to Hawaii create and manage their itineraries, budget plans, and travel logs.

## Design Statement 
In my user research, I found that potential tourists of Hawaii have three major types of needs, which include obtaining accurate and up-to-date information, managing trip plans and logs, as well as interacting with other travelers. Nonetheless, there does not exist one platform that fulfills all three kinds of functions of potential tourists, and thus, by designing this application, I intended to contribute to the tourism of Hawaii, which is one of the pillar industries of Hawaii, by providing a portable travel guide that meets the needs of potential travelers who are interested in visiting Hawaii. 


## Competitor Analysis 
I conducted a competitor analysis of the existing page for travelers on the website of the Kauai County of Hawai. First of all, I conducted a heuristic evaluation on the current webpage for visitors in order to have an initial idea of whether the website offers clear and accurate information for a satisfying user experience. Based on the heuristic evaluation, I found that the current page has issues of 1 to 2 severity ratings with almost all the heuristicsï¼Œespecially with ineffective error prevention, low visibility, and flexibility, as well as lack of freedom and control.

I also conducted a pilot usability test, where I specifically designed a scenario for potential visitors and recruited one participant to actually perform the task and further examined whether the issues found in the heuristic evaluation actually negatively affect the user experience of the website. The usability test helped me recognize the design issues of the website more accurately from the perspective of users. First of all, the current design displays severe issues with flexibility and error prevention. Second, according to the participant, the current design also looks "boring", "cheap", and "outdated".

## User Research 
I then conducted a user study with the contextual inquiry method in order to gain insights into how people employ Internet resources to plan trips. While potential users may turn to traditional solutions, such as travel guides (Lonely Planet), or rating websites (Yelp and Tripadvisor), such platforms all have limitations such as inaccurate, subjective reviews on the dating websites or outdated information on travel guides. In the contextual inquiry, I found that the participant highly relied on reviews of previous travelers to gather basic information about accommodations, local transportation, and tourist attractions. In addition, the participant also tended to use the official government website could offer more accurate, up-to-date, and objective information. The participant also found the local health protocols particularly helpful during the pandemic. The participant also mentioned that the high density of the information on the official government website made it hard for users to quickly access the necessary information. The contextual inquiry presented me with the potential needs of the target users when performing the focus activity, which allowed me to further adjust my design.

## UX Storytelling
The first goal of my UX storytelling is to create personas that represent the potential users of my design, which is a website that helps travellers create and share travel plans based on accurate and up-to-date information. The second goal of my UX storytelling is to generate possible scenarios in which the potential users may find the design helpful. With UX Storytelling, I intend to put myself in the potential users' shoes and try to visualize their needs and challeges. I designed two personas for the project. The needs of the first persona is to interact with other travelers oneline and share her own travel memories. The needs of the second persona is to find ideal destinations of her family trip and to make trip plans, budget plans, and travel logs.

## Low-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of designing and testing the low-fidelity prototype is to gain insights from potential users to assess whether the current design is easy to interact with. More importantly, the low-fidelity prototype allows the designers to create an initial sketch of the ultimate design in a low-cost and less time-consuming way. Furthermore, during the test, the designers are able to identify potential design errors and further improve the design by reflecting on where the users get confused or get stuck. I designed a low-fidelity prototype that should let the users perform the following two tasks. 

### Task 1 
An interactive map that allows people to browse pictures taken at the destination, which further link to the destination and the travel diaries of users.

### Task 2 
A travel itinerary portal that allows people to create, edit, and manage their travel plans.

## High-fidelity prototype 
After designing a low-fidelity prototype and determining the graphic and interface designs, I designed the high-fidelity prototype. In the interactive prototype, potential users may create travel diaries, look for sightseeing places on a map, check information, and browse the travel pictures and diaries of other travelers. While I was designing the interface of the prototype, I reflected back on the results of the pilot usability test and aimed at designing a prototype that contrasts with the current webpage for visitors that is "old, cheap, and not easy to follow". I particularly paid attention to the accessibility of the interface. When I designed the wireflow of the high-fidelity prototype, I also reflected back on the initial heuristic evaluation and contextual inquiry to ensure that the prototype is not confusing and provides clear and accurate information for users.

## Evaluation and Revision 
### Impression test for grahpic design 

I conducted an impression test for the initial graphic design. According to the participant, there was some issue with the background color of a photo gallery feature. I then adjusted the color theme of the feature based on the feedback.

## Conclusion 
In summary, I learned a lot from the design process of this "Travel in Hawaii" application prototype. First of all, it allows me to learn about the necessary steps in the complete process of designing a prototype, including the initial competitor analysis, user research, and graphics and interface design. Specifically, I found the pilot usability test, the contextual inquiry, the impression test, and the cognitive walkthrough particularly helpful, as in these steps, I learned about how user experience research should be conducted to obtain feedback from the potential users. I think the design process generally went smoothly, but I also encountered several challenges. For instance, I found the graphics design particularly challenging as I found it rather difficult to find a color scheme that aesthetically fits the ideal style of the application while keeping the accessibility. I learned about the importance of adopting color contrast and text size to make the application more accessible. In conclusion, I found the project offers a really valuable opportunity to actually learn about user design and user experience research in a hands-on way.
