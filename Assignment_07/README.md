## Assignment 07: High-Fidelity Prototype

## Purpose of Project 
For this project, I designed a smart phone application for the official government of Hawaii that targets at the potential travelers who are interested in visiting Hawaii. First of all, this application aims to provide updated and accurate information on sightseeing attractions for visitors, such as whether the sightseeing locaiton is accessible, whether masks or vaccination records are required, or whether the place is family-friendly. Specifically, the application aims to allow travelers in Hawaii to browse sightseeing attractions as well as upload travel photos and diaries of their own. In addition, the application also aims to help potential travellers to Hawaii create and manage their itineraries, budget plans, and travel logs.

The interactive prototype was developed based on the low-fidelity prototype. In the interactive prototype, potential users may create travel diarties, look for sightseeing places on a map, check information, and browse the travel pictures and diaries of other travelers.  

## Tasks
### Task 1 
> Potential users will be able to view their own travel blog page and create travel diaries, budget plans, and itineraries. The users will also be able to create these files by clicking on a "pen" icon on the top right corner of the screen. 

### Task 2 
> Potential users will be able to search for specific sightseeing locations in Hawaii, view them on an interactive map, check the accurate and updated information about the locations, such as health protocals, as well as check the photos and travel diaries of other travelers that have been uploaded to the page.
