## The Purpose of UX Storytelling 
The purpose of UX storytelling in general is to first of all identify the potential target users of the design and thus to examine the design from the perspective of the users. The first goal of my UX storytelling is to create personas that represent the potential users of my design, which is a website that helps travellers create and share travel plans based on accurate and up-to-date information. The second goal of my UX storytelling is to generate possible scenarios in which the potential users may find the design helpful. With UX Storytelling, I intend to put myself in the potential users' shoes and try to visualize their needs and challeges.
