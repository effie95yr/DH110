## Assignment 05: Low-Fidelity Prototype 
---
## The Purpose of Prototype 
The purpose of designing and testing the low-fidelity prototype is to gain insights from potential users to assess whether the current design is easy to interact with. More importantly, the low-fidelity prototype allows the designers to create an initial sketch of the ultimate design in a low-cost and less time-consuming way. Furthermore, during the test, the designers are able to identify potential design errors and further improve the design by reflecting on where the users get confused or get stuck. 

## Summary of User Research 
The project aims to provide solutions to travelers with an application that integrates the functions of a travel guide and a trip planner. 

## Summary of Persona 
The designer created two personas. The needs of the first persona is to interact with other travelers oneline and share her own travel memories. The needs of the second persona is to find ideal destinations of her family trip and to make trip plans, budget plans, and travel logs.
