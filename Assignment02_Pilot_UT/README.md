### Description of Purpose 
The purpose of the study is to test the usability of the official government website of the Kauai County. In the heuristic evaluation, I found that although the government website is supposed to provide accurate information on the responsibilities, policies, services, and organization of the county government, the design of the website presents rather severe usability issues, including ineffective error prevention, low visibility and flexibility, as well as lack of freedom and control. In the meantime, the website does present a rather visible help function with a search engine. Therefore, in the usability test, I would like to design three scenarios involving three groups of potential users of the website, residents looking for government information, residents planning to apply for certain permits from the government, and visitors to Kauai. I designed one task for each of the scenarios and recruited one participant for my pilot test. In the test, I asked the participant to perform the three tasks to further examine whether the issues found in the heuristic evaluation actually negatively affect the user experience of the website.
