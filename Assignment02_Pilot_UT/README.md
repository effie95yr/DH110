### Description of Purpose 
The purpose of the study is to test the usability of the official government website of the Kauai County. In the heuristic evaluation, I found that although the government website is supposed to provide accurate information on the responsibilities, policies, services, and organization of the county government, the design of the website presents rather severe usability issues, including ineffective error prevention, low visibility and flexibility, as well as lack of freedom and control. In the meantime, the website does present a rather visible help function with a search engine. Therefore, in the usability test, I would like to design three scenarios involving three groups of potential users of the website, residents looking for government information, residents planning to apply for certain permits from the government, and visitors to Kauai. I designed one task for each of the scenarios and recruited one participant for my pilot test. In the test, I asked the participant to perform the three tasks to further examine whether the issues found in the heuristic evaluation actually negatively affect the user experience of the website.

### Reflection
Generally, the usability test was successful in guiding the participant through the three tasks. Although due to the usability issues of the website, the participant failed to complete all of the tasks, there was little confusion or inaccuracy in the test itself. Nonetheless, I did find that in order to keep the participant thinking and talking aloud while using the website, I needed to keep reminding her to verbally describe each step that she chose during the tasks, as participants may be too focused on the tasks to remember describing their moves. In addition, I found that the survey itself needs to be user-friendly, such as using consistent and understandable language in the instructions, and I should have left space in the multiple-choice questions for the participant to fill in their own comments. 

Regarding the usability test, the website presents severe issues in flexibility and error prevention particularly. For instance, when the participant misclicked a link and wanted to go back to the previous page, there was no flexible link to allow such an action. In addition, the design of the website lacks recognizing signs and thus requires the participant to remember the structure of the website. Furthermore, the help function, the search bar did not seem to fulfill its purpose in the tasks, as the participant tried multiple times to search certain information in the search bar, but the results were rather unclear and redundant. 

Comparing the participant's answers to the pre-test questions and the post-test questions, we could see that while the participant gave a rating of 4 for easiness and a 5 for trustworthiness, she then chose "somewhat disagree" for the statement "the website is easy to use". In addition, she chose descriptions such as "boring", "cheap", and "old" for the website in the post-test section. 

In summary, the usability test helped me recognize the design issues of the website more accurately from the perspective of users.
